# Epoch Clock for Filecoin

This simple web application displays the current epoch and local time for the Filecoin network. Users can also input a specific epoch to find out the exact date and time it occurred. It's created just for fun and can be helpful for network updates or other purposes.

The website uses the Glif API to fetch the current epoch and JavaScript to calculate the local time and convert epochs to human-readable dates and times. The design is inspired by the color schemes of Filecoin, Lotus, and IPFS.
